  <strong>I don't have a Prismic repository and would like to create one.</strong>
</summary>

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

   Use the Prismic CLI to create a new Prismic repository and Gatsby project in one command.

   ```sh
   npx prismic-cli@latest theme --theme-url https://github.com/prismicio-community/gatsby-starter-prismic
   ```

   This will create a new Prismic repository with a minimal Custom Type called Page.

2. **Configure the starter.**

   Create a `.env` file with your Prismic repository name, Custom Types API token, and Access Token (optional).

   See `.env.example` for an example file with instructions on how to create your tokens.

3. **Start developing.**

   In your project, start the Gatsby development server.

   ```sh
   npm run develop
   ```

You can delete the `/customtypes` directory a the root of the project at this point.

Have fun developing!
